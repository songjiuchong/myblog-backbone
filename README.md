# myblog-backbone
myblog web app based on Backbone.js, underscore.js, Node.js(Express), semantic-ui and mongoDB.

In this branch(develop), all the settings of this reop are set to locally test this web app(http://localhost:3000) with local MongoDB used to save user data. 

My note for Sematic-ui, refer to: https://github.com/songjiuchong/memos/blob/master/semantic-ui%20guide/semantic-ui%20%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8.md
